## RequirementsÂ¶
 - Python 3.8+

FastAPI stands on the shoulders of giants:

 - Starlette for the web parts.
 - Pydantic for the data parts.

## Run server

This examples need the pipenv shell activated to work -> run: $ pipenv shell (to activate the env)

Then cd into the example you want to run

Then run the server

```console
$ uvicorn main:app --reload 
```
<!-- --reload is to restart the server every time something changes  -->
